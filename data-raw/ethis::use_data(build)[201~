     ‘use_data()’ makes it easy to save package data in the correct
     format. I recommend you save scripts that generate package data in
     ‘data-raw’: use ‘use_data_raw()’ to set it up. You also need to
     document exported datasets.

     ...: Unquoted names of existing objects to save.

internal: If ‘FALSE’, saves each object in its own ‘.rda’ file in the
          data/ directory. These data files bypass the usual export
          mechanism and are available whenever the package is loaded
          (or via ‘data()’ if ‘LazyData’ is not true).

          If ‘TRUE’, stores all objects in a single ‘R/sysdata.rda’
          file. Objects in this file follow the usual export rules.
          Note that this means they will be exported if you are using
          the common ‘exportPattern()’ rule which exports all objects
          except for those that start with ‘.’.

overwrite: By default, ‘use_data()’ will not overwrite existing files.
          If you really want to do so, set this to ‘TRUE’.

compress: Choose the type of compression used by ‘save()’. Should be
          one of "gzip", "bzip2", or "xz".

 version: The serialization format version to use. The default, 2, was
          the default format from R 1.4.0 to 3.5.3. Version 3 became
          the default from R 3.6.0 and can only be read by R versions
          3.5.0 and higher.

    name: Name of the dataset to be prepared for inclusion in the
          package.

    open: Open the newly created file for editing? Happens in RStudio,
          if applicable, or via ‘utils::file.edit()’ otherwise.
