Description: Functions for calculating (1) shadow heights; (2) shadow footprint on ground polygons; and (3) Sky View Factor values. Inputs include a polygonal layer of obstacle outlines along with their heights, sun azimuth and sun elevation. The package also provides functions for related preliminary calculations: breaking polygons into line segments, finding segment azimuth, shifting segments by azimuth and distance, and constructing the footprint of a line of sight between an observer and the sun.
